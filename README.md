# Human Emotion Classifier
This project consists of Human Emotion Classifier Model, wherein the models have been created after havving deeply augmented the dataset, in order to avoid Overfitting. The dataset has been trained on several popular CNN Architectures, such as LeNet-5,AlexNet,VGGNet-19,ResNet,MobileNet & EfficientNet. I have scratch coded few of CNN Architectures as part of learning process. I have also used transfer-learning for few of the architectures. ResNet has been scratch coded using the concept of Model-Subclassing. I have also created a UI using Gradio, wherein you can upload the image, and can choose from variety of models thru a dropdown menu, The output will be what type of emotion the input has, along with accuracy. I haven't deployed the model yet. I am hoping to do so in the future.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project has been taken from Kaggle. I have uploaded the link below.
